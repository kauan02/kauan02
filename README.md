## ✨ My Mission

> **“To turn curiosity into code, and data into insights.”**

I’m currently diving deep into the world of **Python**, **Data Analysis**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Machine Learning**. I'm building hands-on projects and continuously learning to become a solid professional in this field.

🎯 _Focused on:_  
- Data manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy`  
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` & `seaborn`  
- Machine Learning models using `scikit-learn`  
- Neural networks and deep learning (soon!)  
- Problem solving and automation with Python
